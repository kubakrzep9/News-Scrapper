(NASDAQ: VERU), an oncology\nbiopharmaceutical company, today announced\npositive efficacy and safety results from a\nplanned interim analysis of the double-blind,\nrandomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3\nCOVID-19 clinical trial evaluating oral sabizabulin\n9 mg versus placebo in 150 hospitalized\nCOVID-19 patients at high risk for Acute\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The\nIndependent Data Safety Monitoring Committee\nunanimously recommended that the Phase 3\nstudy be halted early due to efficacy, and they\nfurther remarked that no safety concerns were\nidentified.\n\nPhase 3 COVID-19 Trial Design\n\nThe Phase 3 COVID-19 study is a double-blind,\nrandomized, placebo-controlled Phase 8 clinical\ntrial evaluating oral, once-a-day dosing of\nsabizabulin 9 mg versus placebo in approximately\n210 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19\npatients (= WHO 4) who were at high risk for\nARDS and death. Patients were randomized ina\n2:1 ratio to the sabizabulin treatment group versus\nplacebo. Patients in both treatment groups were\nallowed to receive standard of care including\nremdesivir, dexamethasone, anti-IL6 receptor\nantibodies, and JAK inhibitors. The trial was\nconducted in the United States, Brazil, Colombia,\nArgentina, Mexico, and Bulgaria. COVID-19\ninfections treated in the study included the\n\nDelta and Omicron variants. A planned interim\nanalysis was conducted in the first 150 patients\nrandomized into the study. The primary efficacy\nendpoint was the proportion of patients that died\nOVA DE WAoley\n\nClinical Efficacy and Safety Results\n\nThe prespecified primary endpoint was death\nat or before day 60. Sabizabulin treatment\nresulted in a clinically and statistically meaningful\n55% relative reduction in deaths (p=0.0029)\n\nin the intent to treat population. Placebo group\n(n=52) had a 45% mortality rate compared to\nthe sabizabulin-treated group (n=98) which had\na 20% mortality rate. The secondary efficacy\nendpoints are still being analyzed at the time of\nthis release.\n\nSabizabulin treatment was well tolerated in this\npatient population with no clinically relevant safety\nobservations in the sabizabulin treated group\ncompared to placebo.\n\nRegulatory Discussions and Planning\n\nThe Company plans to meet with FDA to\n\ndiscuss next steps including the submission of\nan emergency use authorization application. As\npreviously disclosed, the FDA granted Fast Track\ndesignation to the sabizabulin COVID-19 clinical\nprogram in January 2022, which the Company\nhopes will help streamline the emergency use\nauthorization process.\n\nThe Company has scaled up manufacturing\nprocesses to produce commercial drug supply\nto address anticipated drug needs following\npotential FDA authorization.\n\nThe Company has been in discussions with\nBARDA and other US government agencies\nin an effort to Secure an advance purchasing\nagreement of drug product for the US.\n\n“This study represents a significant milestone in\nthe global fight against COVID-19 as sabizabulin\nis the first drug to demonstrate a clinically and\nstatistically meaningful reduction in deaths in\nhospitalized patients with moderate to severe\nCOVID-19,” said Mitchell Steiner, M.D., Chairman,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of Veru.\n“We strongly believe that sabizabulin, with its\ndual anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties\nwhich demonstrated positive efficacy and safety\nresults in the Phase 3 COVID-19 study, can be\nthat greatly needed oral therapy for hospitalized\nmoderate to severe COVID-19 patients,” Dr.\nSteiner continued.\n\n“What makes these findings more relevant is that\nthe pharmacological activity of sabizabulin is\nindependent of COVID-19 variant type. Pending\nupcoming discussion with FDA, this treatment\noption may be made available soon so we can be\nready for when the next clinically important wave\nof COVID infections comes,” said Gary Barnette,\nPhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Veru.\n\n“We expect new COVID-19 variant infections and\nnew challenges in the treatment of hospitalized\npatients, particularly as the country heads into"
