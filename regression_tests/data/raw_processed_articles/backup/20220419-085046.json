(“Petros’” or “the\nCompany”) (Nasdaq: PTPI), a leading provider\n\nof therapeutics for men’s health, today provides\npositive results from its over-the-counter (OTC)\ndraft label comprehension study for its erectile\ndysfunction (ED) drug STENDRA (avanafil), which\ndemonstrate understanding of the messages\ntherein. These results suggest that the draft\n\ndrug facts labeling language as written may be\nappropriate for submission to the FDA for review\nfor over-the-counter labeling.\n\nThe Pivotal Label Comprehension Study\ncompiled 453 label comprehension interviews\n\n— including a significant cohort of low health\nliteracy individuals — to determine comprehension\nof draft drug facts labeling for STENDRA. In\nsummary, the proposed over-the-counter (OTC)\nlabeling was well understood, according to the\nstudy parameters, by those consumers who\nparticipated. More than 95% of participants\nprovided correct or acceptable responses to\nquestions that evaluated comprehension of\n\nnine primary communication messages. These\nincluded whether STENDRA can be used if\n\nan individual takes nitrate medication or does\nnot have erectile dysfunction. Interestingly,\ncomprehension among the low health literacy\nindividuals, while modestly lower than those with\nbetter health understanding, still demonstrated a\nhigh level of comprehension.\n\n“The results of this label comprehension study\nhelp us to continue to solidify our plans to apply\nto the FDA to help expand access for STENDRA\nbeyond the prescription model, and, if approved\nby the FDA, to make STENDRA potentially the\nfirst prescription-grade ED medication to become\navailable over-the-counter in the United States,”\ncommented Fady Boctor, Petros’s President and\nChief Commercial Officer. “The switch to OTC\n\nis one of many approaches we are currently\nexploring to expand access to STENDRA. We\nremain steadfast in our dedication to men with ED\nby providing new and innovative options to help\nthem safely, securely, and discreetly obtain this\nmedication.”\n\nIt is estimated that only about 25% of the\napproximately 30 million men suffering from\nerectile dysfunction in the U.S. have received oral\nerectile dysfunction therapy.\n\nAbout STENDRA® (avanafil)\n\nSTENDRA® (avanafil), originally launched by\nAuxilium Pharmaceuticals prior to that company's\nsale to Endo Pharmaceuticals, is an oral\nphosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor for the\n\npe ey Ee ee pl ee he ee Lee’ EG) ae"
