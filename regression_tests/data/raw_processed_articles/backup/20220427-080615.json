(NASDAQ-:VIVK), a socially\nresponsible operator, acquirer and developer of\nclean energy technologies and environmental\nsolutions (\"Vivakor\" or the \"Companyâ€™), is pleased\nto announce the signing of a 10-year contract (the\n\"Agreement') with Hot Oil Transport, LLC (\"HOT\"),\na supplier of asphalt materials, which HOT in turn\nsupplies to Southwest Liquid Asphalt & Emulsions\n(\"SLA\"), a major supplier of polymerized asphalt in\nSouthern Nevada. Based on the current asphalt\nwholesale index price for the Rocky Mountain\nregion, this contract could be valued at up to\n$250 million over the life of the contract, provided\nthat Vivakor is able to ramp up and operate its\nVernal, Utah site at full capacity.\n\nSLA's largest customer is Las Vegas Paving, one\nof the largest road construction companies in\nthe state of Nevada, with revenues of more than\n$500 million annually. Under the Agreement,\nVivakor can provide HOT with up to 50,000 tons\nof ratable asphalt cement from Vivakor's Vernal,\nUtah, upon completion of anticipated scaled up\noperations, annually for a period of ten years.\nPricing will be based on the asphalt wholesale\nindex price for the Rocky Mountain region at\n\nthe time of delivery. Based on the current index\npricing range of $510 to $600 per ton, this\ncontract could generate between $25 million\nand $30 million in annual sales once the project\nis operating at full capacity. To operate at full\ncapacity and take advantage of the maximum\nopportunity under the contract with HOT, Vivakor\nestimates it would need to add three additional\nRemediation Processing Centers (RPCs), as well\nas ramp up other required infrastructure, at the\nVernal, Utah site, with an estimated total cost of\n$18 million.\n\n\"As this is our first long-term contract for sale of\nour asphaltic binder, it is an important milestone\nfor Vivakor. We have worked closely with HOT to\nrefine our product to meet their specifications,\"\nsaid Matt Nicosia, CEO of Vivakor. \"We have\nalready produced tonnage of asphaltic cement\nwith our Vernal, Utah RPC and believe that by\n\nthe end of the year we will have ramped up our\ninfrastructure to include three additional RPCs to\noperate the site to the level required to fulfill the\nfull amount of material requested by HOT on an\nannualized basis. This could be a significant event\nfor shareholders as this project, when fully scaled,\ncould contribute meaningful profits.\"\n\nGene Chrisenbery, Manager of HOT, stated,\n\"Demand for asphaltic binder has been\nincreasing as a direct result of new governmental\ninfrastructure spending and general supply\nconstraints. This long-term contract for Vivakor's\nasphaltic binder will help meet this increased\ndemand and thus give us an added benefit of\nasphaltic binder that is reclaimed from waste\nand produced in an environmentally conscious\nmanner. Our customers are seeking supplies\nmanufactured in the cleanest possible manner\nand we believe that our relationship with Vivakor\nwill allow us to deliver just that.\"\n\nAbout Vivakor, Inc.\n\nVivakor, Inc.
