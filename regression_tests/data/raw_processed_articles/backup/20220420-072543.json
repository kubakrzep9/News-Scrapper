This is the third RMAT designation that\nFDA has granted to posoleucel, in recognition\n\nof the therapy’s transformative potential to\naddress significant unmet medical needs facing\nimmunocompromised allo-HCT patients.\n\nThe FDA previously granted RMAT designation\nto posoleucel for the treatment of hemorrhagic\ncystitis (HC) caused by BKV in adults and\nchildren following allo-HCT and for the treatment\nof adenovirus infection following allo-HCT. RMAT\ndesignation enables early interactions with the\nFDA to discuss clinical trial design and other\nactions to expedite development and review.\nOutside of the United States, the European\nMedicines Agency has granted posoleucel\nPRlority Medicines (PRIME) designation for the\ntreatment of serious infections with AdV, BKV,\nCMV, EBV and HHV-6.\n\n“The receipt of three RMAT designations for a\nsingle therapy is unprecedented. Posoleucel’s\nthree RMAT designations reflect the strength\n\nof AlloVir’s multi-virus platform and its potential\nboth to deliver an important treatment option for\nimmunocompromised patients who currently\nhave none, and to transform the management of\nallo-HCT patients with a multi-virus prevention\napproach,” said Ercem Atillasoy, M.D., Chief\nRegulatory and Safety Officer, AlloVir.\n\nPosoleucel has the potential to fundamentally\ntransform the landscape for allo-HCT by\npreventing life-threatening viral diseases and\ninfections, either as a prophylactic therapy in\nhigh-risk patients or as a preemptive therapy in\npatients who have already reactivated one or\nmore of the six viruses targeted by posoleucel. As\n90% of allo-HCT patients reactivate at least one\nof these viruses, there is a large global market\nopportunity for the prevention of devastating viral\ndiseases, with an estimated addressable patient\npopulation of 40,000 allo-HCT patients annually.\n\nThe new RMAT designation was based on\n\ninitial data from an open-label Phase 2 study\nevaluating the potential for posoleucel to prevent\nlife-threatening infections from six common\nviruses following allo-HCT. Initial data from this\nstudy were most recently presented at the 48th\nAnnual Meeting of the European Society for\nBlood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in\nMarch 2022. Out of 26 patients who received\n\nat least one dose of posoleucel in the ongoing\nPhase 2 trial, and including those who completed,\ndiscontinued or are continuing posoleucel,\n\nonly three clinically significant infections were\nobserved through Week 14, as of the data\ncut-off for this analysis. Of the 24 patients who\nhad reached the Week 14 primary endpoint, 21\nremained free of clinically significant infections.\nRepeat dosing was generally well-tolerated. Final\nresults of the Phase 2 study are expected to be\navailable at the end of this year.\n\nAbout Posoleucel\n\nAlloVir’s lead product, posoleucel, is in\nlate-stage clinical development as an\nallogeneic, off-the-shelf, multi-virus specific\nT cell therapy targeting six viral oathogens in"
