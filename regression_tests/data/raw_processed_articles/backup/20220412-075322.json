(Nasdaq; LIXT), a clinical-stage\npharmaceutical company focused on developing\nand commercializing cancer therapies,\nannounces that Professor René Bernards,\nNetherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), Amsterdam,\npresented new data from promising drug\ncombinations of LIXTE’s lead clinical cancer\ncompound, LB-100, at the Annual Meeting of\nAmerican Association for Cancer Research\n(AACR) in New Orleans, LA, on Monday, April 11,\n2022.\n\nIn brief, LIXTE’s first-in-class lead clinical\ncompound and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)\ninhibitor, LB-100, induces further activation of\noncogenic signaling in a number of KRAS-mutant\ncancers, rendering them particularly vulnerable\nto anti-cancer therapy. Professor Bernards’\npresentation, entitled “Unconventional\nApproaches to the Treatment of Cancer”, was\ndelivered as part of the events celebrating\nProfessor Bernards’ selection as the awardee of\nthe 2022 AACR Princess Takamatsu Memorial\nLectureship. The AACR has stated that this\naward “recognizes an individual scientist whose\nnovel and significant work has had or may have a\nfar-reaching impact on the detection, diagnosis,\ntreatment, or prevention of cancer, and who\nembodies the dedication of [Princess Takamatsu]\nto multinational collaborations.” AACR is the\nlargest cancer research organization in the world,\nwith more than 50,000 members residing in 129\ncountries and territories.\n\nProfessor Bernards discussed his paradoxical\napproach to developing more effective cancer\ntherapies. The initial studies, done in collaboration\nwith LIXTE, reveal that the vigorous activation\n\nof several oncogenic signaling pathways by\nLB-100 is associated with marked increases in\nDNA damage and mitotic stress. CRISPR-based\ngenetic screening and screening of selected\ninvestigational compounds both showed that\nLB-100 is synthetically lethal in combination\nwith inhibitors of the mitotic entry kinase WEE1.\nResults were confirmed in a group of colorectal\ncancer cell lines bearing diverse mutations. The\nmechanisms responsible for these unexpected\nactivities of LB-100 combined with WEE1 kinase\ninhibitors, were presented.\n\nJohn S. Kovach MD, Founder and CEO of LIXTE\nBiotechnology Holdings, Inc., said “we are\ndelighted to be working with Professor Bernards\nand his team. Professor Bernards’ insights and\ncontributions enable us to take full advantage\n\nof the unique anti-cancer properties of LB-100.\nHis creativity in developing new anti-cancer\n\ndrug combinations has already had a significant\nimpact on cancer care. His current observations\nof unexpected synergy of LB-100 with a variety\nof standard agents and with investigational\ncompounds with only modest activity on their own\nare promising leads to a new approach to cancer\nchemotherapy."
