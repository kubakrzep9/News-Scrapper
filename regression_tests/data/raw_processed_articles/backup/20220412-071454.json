[Nasdaq:\nBCDA], a developer of cellular and cell-derived\ntherapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular\nand pulmonary diseases, today announced that\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nhas approved the Company's Investigational\nNew Drug (IND) application for BCDA-04, a\nproprietary allogeneic mesenchymal cell (MSC)\npopulation that is Neurokinin-1 receptor positive\n(NKiR+). This allows BioCardia to initiate its\nFirst-in-Human Phase I/II trial in adult patients\nrecovering from Acute Respiratory Distress\nSyndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19, with trial\ninitiation expected in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThe first part of the clinical trial will evaluate\nincreasing doses of the NK1R+ MSCs and\n\nthe optimal dose will be taken to Phase Il ina\nrandomized study in adult patients recovering\nfrom ARDS due to COVID-19. \"This investigational\ncell therapy is administered intravenously (IV)\nand follows a significant body of compelling\nclinical results by NIH investigators and peer\ncompanies,\" said lan McNiece, Ph.D., BioCardia’s\nChief Scientific Officer. \"After IV delivery, the cells\nmigrate to the lungs for local therapeutic benefit.\nWe expect the anti-inflammatory nature of these\nmesenchymal stem cells to have a positive\nimpact in ARDS because of the interaction of\n\nthe Neurokinin-1 receptors with Substance P, a\nneuropeptide that has long been known to be a\nprimary mediator of inflammation in the lungs. Our\ngoal is to help recovering patients with ARDS due\nto COVID-19 recover faster and more fully, while\navoiding longer term respiratory issues.\"\n\n\"In addition to our critically important autologous\ncell therapies being studied for ischemic heart\nfailure and chronic myocardial ischemia with\nrefractory angina, the FDA's acceptance of\n\nthis IND for patients recovering from ARDS is\n\nan important milestone in the development of\nour allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy\nplatform and validation for its potential to provide\ntherapeutic benefit beyond the cardiovascular\nsystem,\" said Peter Altman, Ph.D., Chief Executive\nOfficer. \"Our ‘off the shelf MSC platform may\nhave significant advantages over others in clinical\ndevelopment for multiple indications because\nthe MSCs express the biologically important NK1\nreceptor which binds Substance P. Our in-house\nClinical cell manufacturing is also expected to be\nan important strategic asset that enables rapid\nand cost-effective development.\"\n\nAbout ARDS\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\noccurs when fluid builds up in the tiny, elastic air\nsacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The fluid keeps the\nlungs from filling with enough air, which means\n"
