(NYSE: American AIM)\n(“AIM” or the “Company’), an immuno-pharma\ncompany focused on the research and\ndevelopment of therapeutics to treat multiple\ntypes of cancers, immune disorders, and viral\ndiseases, including COVID-19, the disease\ncaused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, today\nannounced the presentation of data from the\nongoing Phase 2a clinical study at Roswell Park\nComprehensive Cancer Center evaluating AIM\n\nImmunoTech Inc. drug candidate, Neca\n(also known as rintatolimod) as a component of\ntreatment for colorectal cancer metastatic to\nthe liver at the American Association for Cancer\nResearch (AACR) Annual Meeting 2022, being\nheld April 8-18, 2022, in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThe presented research was led by Roswell Park\nmedical oncologist Sarbajit Mukherjee, MD, MS,\nin collaboration with senior investigator Pawel\nKalinski, MD, PhD, Chair of Immunology at Roswell\nPark.\n\nTitle: /nitial results of a phase II study evaluating\na chemokine-modulatory (CKM) regimen in\npatients with colorectal cancer metastatic to the\nlie\n\nPresenter: Sarbajit Mukherjee, MD, MS\n\nBased on preclinical data and previous reports\nshowing the prognostic value of intratumoral\n\n(orbs Ma Merl] (CTL) in colorectal cancer (CRC)\noutcomes, it was hypothesized that systemic\ninfusion of the combination of IFNa-2b with\nAmpligen (selective TLRS ligand for iv. use)\n\ncould reprogram the local balance between\n\nthe CTL- and regulatory T cell (Treg)-attracting\nchemokines and the resulting patterns of immune\ninfiltrates in liver tumors.\n\nThis early Phase 2a trial studied how well\ncelecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and\nAmpligen work in treating patients with colorectal\ncancer that has spread to the liver. The study was\ndesigned on the basis that 1) celecoxib may stop\nthe growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the\nenzymes needed for cell growth; 2) Recombinant\ninterferon alfa-2b is a substance that can improve\nthe body's natural response and may interfere\nwith the growth of tumor cells; and 3) Ampligen\nmay stimulate the immune system, so that giving\ncelecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and\nAmpligen together may help reprogram the tumor\nmicroenvironment and make the tumors more\nresponsive to immune therapy.\n\nFor the study, recurrent/metastatic CRC patients\nwith unresectable liver metastases amenable to\nbiopsy were eligible. Patients had prior treatment\n(Rx) with fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin,\nand an anti-EGFR targeted therapy (if RAS wt),\nor contra-indication to such. Patients received\nIFNa-2b IV (20 million units/m2 IV daily) and\nAmpligen (200 mg IV daily) plus oral celecoxib\n(200 mg twice daily) on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15,\n16, and 17. Response assessment was done via\nliver biopsies (pre-Rx and on day 24 + 4 days)\nand CT imaging (RECIST v11) on Day 46. The\nprimary endpoint was the change in CD8+ T-cells\nbefore Rx, with that seen post-Rx (measured\n\nby quantitative RT-PCR as a ratio of CD8a toa\nhousekeeping gene, HPRT). With a sample size\nof N=12 evaluable pts, the study design had a\n90% power to detect a 0.77 standard deviation\nincrease (jre- to post Rx) at a significance level\nof 0.1. Nineteen patients with microsatellite stable\n(MSS) CRC were enrolled in the study between\nApr 2018 and Oct 2020, and 12 were evaluable\nfor the primary endpoint.\n\n“The primary endpoint of this study, a significant\nincrease in CD8a expression post-treatment,\nalong with increases in CTL-attracting\nchemokines coupled with a decrease in a key\nTreg/MDSC attractant indicate a positive immune\neffect on the tumor microenvironment and\nsuggest this CKM approach has the potential\n\nto increase tumor responses to checkpoint\ninhibitors’, commented David R. Strayer, MD.\n\nSummary of Key Findings:\n-The study's primary endpoint was met,\n\nevidenced by increased CD8a expression\npost-treatment (p=0.046)."
