(Nasdaq;\nNKTX), a biopharmaceutical company developing\nengineered natural killer cell therapies to treat\ncancer, today announced positive preliminary\nPhase 1 data from independent dose finding\nstudies of its two lead chimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) natural killer (NK) cell therapy candidates,\nNKX101 and NKX0O19Q, in two distinct groups of\nhematologic malignancies.\n\n“We're excited to see our CAR NK co-lead\ncandidates, NKX101 and NKX019, show\n\nsuch striking early single-agent activity in\n\nheavily pretreated patient populations, with\n\nan exceptional safety profile without the side\neffects associated with CAR T cell therapies,”\nsaid Paul J. Hastings, President and CEO of\nNkarta. “These encouraging data across multiple\nindications further validate Nkarta’s best-in-class\nNK cell platform, as we seek to transform\n\ncancer treatment by bringing together the safety\nadvantages of NK cells with an off-the-shelf\nmodality designed to make the benefits of cell\ntherapy accessible in a community setting.”\n\nIn the first trial, evaluating NKX101, in relaosed /\nrefractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\nand myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), three of\nfive patients with heavily pre-treated AML who\nreceived the higher dose level in a three-dose\nregimen achieved a complete response (60%\nCR) with hematologic recovery, with two of the\nthree responses MRD (minimal residual disease)\nnegative. There is currently no standard of care\nfor these patients.\n\nIn the second trial, evaluating NKX0O19, in r/r B cell\nmalignancies, three of six patients treated at the\nhigher dose level in a three-dose regimen showed\na complete response (50% CR), including one\npatient with aggressive diffuse large B cell\nlymphoma (DLBCL) and one patient with mantle\ncell lymphoma (MCL). In both trials, no dose\nlimiting toxicity was observed and there were no\nCART like adverse events of any grade.\n\nNkarta continues to enroll patients in three-dose\nregimens of 1.5 billion NK cells per dose in the\ndose finding portions of the NKX101 and NKX019\ntrials. Data from both programs, including\nadditional follow-up and updates on the higher\ndose cohorts, will be submitted for presentation\nat a future medical meeting.\n\nEvaluating NKX101 in r/r acute myeloid leukemia\nNKxX101 is an allogeneic, cryopreserved,\noff-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy candidate\nthat uses NK cells engineered to target NKG2D\nligands on cancer cells. NKX101 is being\nevaluated in a dose-escalation Phase 1 study as"
