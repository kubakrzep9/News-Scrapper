(NASDAQ: CYCC,\nNASDAQ: CYCCP; \"Cyclacel\" or the \"Company’\"),\na biopharmaceutical company developing\ninnovative medicines based on cancer cell\nbiology, today announced a publication in the\njournal Leukemia titled “Cyclin-dependent\nkinase inhibitor fadraciclib (CYCO65) depletes\nanti-apoptotic protein and synergizes with\nvenetoclax in primary chronic lymphocytic\nleukemia cells’. Fadraciclib is Cyclacel’s novel\nCDK2/9 inhibitor, currently in two Phase 1/2 trials,\none for the treatment of advanced solid tumors\nand lymphomas and another for hematological\nmalignancies, including patients with leukemia\nbeing treated in combination with venetoclax.\n\n“Results from this research provide further\nmechanistic evidence in support of our ongoing\nPhase 1/2 clinical study of oral fadraciclib\n\nin select hematological malignancies,” said\n\nMark Kirschbaum, M.D., Senior Vice President\nand Chief Medical Officer of Cyclacel. “The\nfindings confirmed that fadraciclib suppresses\nMCL1 and synergizes with venetoclax, the only\nFDA-approved apoptosis enabling leukemia\ntreatment. We have included a cohort within the\nproof-of-concept part of our Phase 1/2 study that\nwill evaluate the combination of fadraciclib plus\nvenetoclax in patients who have previously failed\nvenetoclax-based regimens.”\n\nINCsisXcr=18@i f(s] pom [KO AN Ua(omB\\=)@r-]mnnnl~ alm) |\nExperimental Therapeutics and the Department\nof Leukemia at The University of Texas MD\nAnderson Cancer Center published preclinical\ndata interrogating fadraciclib’s mechanism\n\nof action against primary cell lines of chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL), both as a single\nagent and in combination with the BCL2\nantagonist, venetoclax.\n\nResults from the study confirmed that fadraciclib\ninhibited CDKY mediated transcription, reduced\nlevels of the short-lived anti-apoptotic protein\nMCL41, and induced apoptosis in primary CLL\ncells. The data highlighted the importance\n\nof continuous treatment to prevent recovery\n\nof MCL1 protein levels. Fadraciclib is the\n\nonly transcriptional CDK inhibitor in clinical\ndevelopment that is being dosed on a daily\nschedule by mouth.\n\nFadracicliob was shown to combine synergistically\nwith venetoclax, the only FDA-approved\napoptosis enabling, leukemia treatment.\nFurthermore, it was demonstrated that the best\nsynergy, with fadraciclib and venetoclax given at\nthe same time, was achieved in 17p deleted CLL\ncells, which were not sensitive to either agent\nalone.\n\nFadraciclib also overcame protection\nmediated by stroma CLL cells and lymph node\nmicroenvironment. This may be important for\nClinical translation as venetoclax appears to be\n\nless effective in the lymph merece\n\nThe data support the rationale for pursuing\nclinical development of fadraciclib, either alone\nor in combination with a BCL2 antagonist, for the\ntreatment of CLL.\n\nPhase 1/2 Study in Hematological Malignancies\n(065-102; NCT#05168904)\n\nA Phase 1/2 registration-directed trial, testing\noral fadraciclib in various hematological\nmalignancies is currently enrolling patients.\n\nThe trial uses a Streamlined design and will\ndetermine the recommended Phase 2 dose\n(RP2D) for single-agent, oral fadraciclib and\nthen enter into proof-of-concept, cohort stage,\nusing a Simon 2-stage design, where fadraciclib\nwill be administered, both as a single agent\n\nand in combinations, to patients in up to seven\ncohorts relevant to the drug’s mechanism of\naction and informed by the clinical activity of\nfadraciclib in previous studies.\n\nSingle-agent cohorts will include patients with\nacute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic\nsyndromes (MDS) who have an inadequate\nresponse or have progressed on venetoclax\ncombinations with hypomethylating agent (HMA)\nor low dose Ara C; relapsed/refractory AML or\nMDS patients with FLTS, KIT or MAPK pathways\n(including N and K RAS.
