(NYSE AMERICAN: ATNM) (Actinium or\n\nthe Company) a leader in the development of\ntargeted radiotherapies for patients with unmet\nneeds, and Immedica Pharma AB (\"Immedica\u2019)\ntoday announced entering a license and supply\nagreement for lomab-B, an Antibody Radiation\nConjugate comprised of apamistamab, a\n\nCD45 targeting antibody, and the radioisotope\niodine-131 that is being developed for targeted\nconditioning to facilitate bone marrow transplant\n(BMT) and other cell and gene therapies. A\npivotal Phase 8 trial, Study of lomab-B versus\nConventional Care in Elderly, Relapsed or\nRefractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (SIERRA), of\nlomab-B completed patient enrollment in the third\nquarter of 2021 with topline data expected in the\nthird quarter of 2022. BMT is the only potentially\ncurative treatment option for patients with active,\nrelapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia\n(AML).\n\nSandesh Seth, Actinium's Chairman and CEO,\nsaid, \"Immedica has established a strong team\nand impressive capabilities to commercialize\nspecialty products in Europe, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa. Europe and the MENA countries\nare key commercial markets for lomab-B, with\n\na large addressable AML patient population\n\nand access to a strong BMT community that is\nhighly concentrated with select leading centers\nperforming a majority of the BMT procedures.\nDespite multiple drug approvals for patients with\nAML in recent years, curative outcomes and\naccess to potentially curative BMT are severely\nlacking, particularly for patients with active,\nrelapsed or refractory disease. We are excited to\npartner with Immedica to work to bring lomab-B\nto patients with AML in Europe, the Middle\n\nEast and North Africa who may benefit from a\npotentially curative transplant.\"\n\n\"We are excited about the opportunity to make\nlomab-B accessible for patients in Europe, the\nMiddle East and North Africa. It is clear there is\na large medical need for these AML patients,\nwhich we believe will be addressed by this new\ninnovative treatment. We also look forward to\ndeepening our collaboration with Actinium to\nbring the best possible support to AML treatment\ncenters and health care professionals in Europe,\nthe Middle East and North Africa\", says Anders\nEdvell, CEO at Immedica.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Actinium will\nreceive an upfront payment of $35 million and will\nbe eligible to receive an additional $417 million\nin regulatory and commercial milestones as well\nas royalties in the mid-twenty percent range on\nnet sales. Immedica receives commercialization\nrights in Europe and MENA countries. Actinium\nretains all rights related to lomab-B in the United\nStates and the rest of the world, and will be\nresponsible for certain clinical and regulatory\nactivities and the manufacturing of lomab-B.\n\nShadow Lake Group (SLG) served as the advisor\nto Immedica.",
