DriveMod Kit\u2019s inaugural\nmanufacturing run started coming off the\nassembly line in the first half of April 2022.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the\nfull release here: https://www.businesswire.com\n/news/home/20220421005339/en/\n\n \n\n \n\nCyngn launches DriveMod Kit, a turnkey AV\nhardware integration module. Its inaugural\nmanufacturing run began coming off the\nassembly line in early April 2022. Source: Cyngn\n\nContaining all the advanced sensors and\nhardware components needed for AV technology\nintegration, DriveMod kit is designed to\nstreamline retrofitting of existing industrial\nvehicles or simplify integration onto newly\nmanufactured vehicles. We believe that by\neliminating traditional barriers to autonomous\nvehicle adoption, such as high costs and complex\ninstallations, DriveMod Kit will facilitate rapid\nadoption of autonomous vehicles across a wide\nrange of industrial and commercial domains.\n\nPartnering with Columbia Vehicle Group\n(\u201cColumbia\u201d), Cyngn originally developed\nDriveMod Kit as an efficient AV integration\npackage for Columbia\u2019s Stockchaser vehicles.\nThe kit technology can easily be adapted to fit\nother industrial vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to have launched production of\nDriveMod Kit for Columbia\u2019s Stockchaser. With\n883,000 new material-handling vehicles sold\neach year in the U.S., DriveMod Kit creates a\nsizable opportunity for Cyngn to lead the rapid\nadoption of turnkey AV solutions for both retrofit\nand new vehicles. Installation can be done quickly\nand does not require special training. Anyone who\nworks on these vehicles can retrofit an existing\nColumbia Stockchaser into a fully autonomous\nvehicle with very little effort. DriveMod Kit\n\nis acomplete AV integration solution, a\ngame-changer that eliminates traditional barriers\nto autonomous vehicle adoption,\u201d said Lior Tal,\nOnValelaks nO) =O)\n\nIn addition to the self-driving vehicle technology,\nDriveMod Kit features human machine interfaces\nand a lighting system that communicate vehicle\nstatus, mode, battery status, route obstruction,\nand more.\n\nWith the swift and simple deployment that\nDriveMod Kit offers, manufacturers and logistics\ncompanies can begin to reap the many benefits\nof autonomy, such as increased productivity,\nimproved safety, and lowered operational costs.\n\nTo see DriveMod Kit in action, please click here to\nwatch the video.\n",
