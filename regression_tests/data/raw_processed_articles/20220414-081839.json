(NASDAQ:LEXX)\n(NASDAQ:LEXXW) (the \"Company\" or \"Lexaria\u2019),\na global innovator in drug delivery platforms\nannounces that all data analyses from its\nsimulated pulmonary hypertension clinical study\nHYPER-H21-3 have been successfully completed\nwith positive safety and efficacy findings.\n\nThe study findings indicated a tendency (p=0.1)\nduring 15 minutes of simulated low levels of\noxygen (hypoxia) for reduced pulmonary\n\nartery systolic pressure (\"PASP\") with\nDehydraTECH-CBD treatment versus placebo.\nMost notably, PASP was significantly attenuated\nby about 5 mmHg or 41% overall (0=0.045)\n\nin male participants specifically suggesting\ndifferences by sex in responsiveness to CBD\ntreatment under hypoxic stress conditions.\n\nThese findings are complementary to Lexaria's\ngrowing body of evidence demonstrating the\nability of DehydraTECH-CBD to reduce blood\npressure, which it has shown across a wide\nvariety of clinical presentations, ranging from\nindividuals with differing degrees of \"essential\nhypertension\", the most common form of\nhypertension, to individuals with stress-induced\nsimulated pulmonary hypertension as reported\nhere. These new findings from HYPER-H21-3\nwill help direct prospective future research into\nthe efficacy of DehydraTECH-CBD use for the\nmanagement of elevations in pulmonary arterial\npressure under hypoxic conditions (e.g., exposure\nto altitude), related hypoxemic pathologies\n(e.g., severe lung disease), and pulmonary\nhypertension.\n\nLexaria intends to use the data from study\nHYPER-H21-3, together with the findings from its\nother previously announced successful studies\nthat evidenced DehydraTECH-CBD's ability to\nlower human blood pressure, to support Lexaria's\nplans to seek approvals by the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (\"FDA\") to commence formal,\nregistered clinical testing in the treatment of\nhypertension under the Investigational New Drug\n(\"IND\") process.\n\nAs in past studies, all study participants tolerated\nDehydraTECH-CBD well and no serious adverse\nside effects were recorded. Lexaria will continue\nto provide updates on its work towards IND filing\nas they become available.\n\nAbout Study HYPER-H21-3\n\nStudy HYPER-H21-3 used a placebo-controlled\nand double-blinded design, with administration\nof a single 300mg dose of a specific\nDehydraTECH-2.0 CBD formulation compared\nto placebo in a target group of sixteen enrolled\nvolunteers (8 females and 8 males; aged 18-35\nyears). The study participants were subjected\nto a 30-minute period of rest following dosing,\nduring which time they breathed normal room\nair (i.e., 21% oxygen), followed by a 40-minute\nperiod of simulated hypoxia (i.e., 12% oxygen) that\nwas induced in order to safely simulate robust",
