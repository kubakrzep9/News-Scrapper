(NASDAQ:VTNR)\n(\"Vertex Energy\", \"Vertex\" or the \"Company\u2019),\n\na leading specialty refiner and marketer of\nhigh-quality refined products, today announced\nthat it has entered into a 5-year product supply\nagreement with Idemitsu Apollo Renewable\nCorporation (\"Idemitsu\"), a wholly-owned\nCalifornia-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan.\nThe agreement is conditional upon certain\nconditions precedent, including the closing\n\nof Vertex's planned acquisition of the Mobile,\nAlabama refinery (\"Mobile\") as previously\ndisclosed, and the completion of a subsequent\nconversion of the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking\nunit, a project that will facilitate the production\n\nof renewable diesel fuel at the refinery, which\n\nis expected to be completed following the\ncompletion of the acquisition, by year-end 2022.\n\nUnder the terms of its supply agreement\n\nwith Idemitsu, Vertex will supply 100% of the\nrenewable diesel produced at the Mobile refinery\nto Idemitsu during the term of the agreement.\nFurther, as indicated in the supply agreement,\nIdemitsu will pay Vertex for each gallon produced\nat an indexed, spot-market price at the time of\nproduction, resulting in an immediate working\ncapital benefit to Vertex. At current commodity\nand credits values, and assuming the timely\ncompletion of the capital project and ongoing\nproduction at currently projected levels, the\nexpected revenue over the five year agreement\nwould exceed $6 billion.\n\nAs one of the largest suppliers of both\nconventional and renewable fuels in North\nAmerica, Idemitsu is a valued off-take partner\nthat provides Vertex with a depth of product\nmarketing experience and access to growing\nregional markets in the western United States and\nCanada.\n\n\"We are pleased to partner with Idemitsu on this\nimportant agreement, one that will ensure off-take\nfor all produced renewable diesel fuel production\nat the Mobile refinery,\" stated Benjamin P. Cowart,\nPresident and CEO of Vertex, \"As we seek to\nscale renewables production at the Mobile\nrefinery over time, following our acquisition\n\nof such facility, Idemitsu is well-equipped to\n\nplace incremental renewables volumes, given\ntheir extensive distribution network. We believe\nthat this agreement, together with our existing\nconventional fuels off-take agreements with other,\nhigh-quality counterparties, position Vertex for\nsuccess as we move toward the planned closing\nof the Mobile refinery acquisition.\"\n\nABOUT VERTEX ENERGY\n\nHouston-based Vertex Energy, Inc.\n(NASDAQ:VTNR) is a specialty refiner of\nalternative feedstocks and marketer of\nhigh-quality refined products.
