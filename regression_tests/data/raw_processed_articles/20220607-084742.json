(Nasdaq: JAN), a company\n\nthat focuses on the development of drugs\n\nwith non-addictive, pain-relieving properties,\nannounced today that a patent was issued that\ncovers a method of improving nerve function\nusing JAN101. JAN101 (formerly known as\nTV1001SR), is a potential treatment for peripheral\nartery disease (PAD), a vascular disease that\naffects more than 8.5 million people in the US.\nand more than 60 million people worldwide.\n\n\"This patent further protects JanOne Inc.'s\nproduct for use in treating PAD by extending\nthe use of JAN101 to treat the nerve damage\ncaused by microvascular disease,\" said Dr. Tony\nGiordano, JanOne Inc.'s Chief Scientific Officer.\n\"Microvascular disease is a major problem for\nPAD patients: it leads to restricted blood flow in\nthe affected limb, which in turn leads to nerve\ndamage and severe pain. Recent studies have\nin fact suggested that PAD is a microvascular\ndisease, so the observation that JAN101 improves\nmicrovascular and nerve function is crucial in\ntreating this disease.\"\n\nDr. Amol Soin, a leading pain physician and\nJanOne's Chief Medical Officer, added, \"We\nbelieve that nerve damage plays a major role\nin promoting pain and thus studied whether\nJAN101 could improve nerve sensory velocity\nand nerve sensory conductance in a previous\ntrial loversaw. Our previous studies showed\nthat JAN101 improved nerve conduction velocity,\nwhich leads us to believe that it may not only\nimprove pain but could also improve nerve\nfunction.\"\n\nThis method for treating pain was co-discovered\nby Dr. Christopher Kevil, Vice Chancellor for\nResearch and Dean of the School of Graduate\nStudies at LSU Health Shreveport. This newly\napproved patent is owned by LSU Health\nShreveport and is exclusively licensed to JanOne\nInc. It is the latest United States patent to be\nissued in connection with JanOne's Inc.'s PAD and\npain development program.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains statements that are\nforward-looking statements as defined within the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\nincluding, but not limited to, statements relating to\nthe fact that JAN101 will treat PAD, the timing of\nthe commencement of clinical trials, that the FDA\nwill permit approval through a 505(b)(2) pathway,\nthat upon approval JAN101 will immediately\ndisrupt the PAD market, and other statements\n\nincluding words such as \"continue\", \"expect\",\n\"intend\", \"will\", \"hope\" \"should\", \"would\", \"may\",\n\u201cootential\" and other similar expressions. Such\nstatements reflect JanOne Inc.'s current view\nwith respect to future events, are subject to risks\n\nand uncertainties. and are necessarily based",
